# Gait Graph Signal Analysis

This repository contains part of the code used in my **Masterâ€™s Thesis**:

> **Graph Fourier Transform: A Study of Time-Dependent Graph Signals**  
> University of Padua, 2025  
> [Full thesis available here](https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/91831)

The project explores **Graph Signal Processing (GSP)** techniques applied to human gait analysis.  
Specifically, it models human joint dynamics as signals evolving over a 3D skeletal graph,  
analyzing motion through spectral methods such as the **Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)**.
